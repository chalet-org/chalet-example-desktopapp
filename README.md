This repository showcases how to setup a [Chalet](https://www.chalet-work.space) project for OS Desktop Applications. It also includes some basic configuration for use with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

To get started, [download Chalet](https://www.chalet-work.space/download), check out some of the documentation for it, and either build with the various commands from the command line, or try out the [Chalet VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chalet-org.vscode-chalet) (recommended).

At the moment, this is a Windows-only example, with Microsoft's [Creating a Window](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/learnwin32/creating-a-window) example. It was used to test Chalet features at one time.


### Debugging

* For MacOS: Install CodeLLDB and use the "LLDB" launch.json configuration
* For Windows: Install the C/C++ extension and Build with MSVC and use the "MSVC" configuration
* For Linux: Install the C/C++ extension and Use the "GDB" configuration
